# Parcel Service Program
This project is a package delivery system built in Python. The goal was to create an algorithmic solution to ensure a timely delivery of all 40 packages while adhering to 
specific criteria and keeping the combined total distance under 140 miles for two of the three trucks. 
The project encompasses the development of a hash table for package management, an algorithm to handle deliveries, and an interface for real-time tracking.
